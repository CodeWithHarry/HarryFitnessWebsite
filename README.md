# FitnessWebsiteLandingPage

This repository contains the code for a Fitness Website Landing Page built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The landing page features a header with a navigation bar, a hero section with a call-to-action button, a services section with icons, a testimonials section with customer reviews, and a contact section with a form.

The project structure consists of an index.html file for the main HTML content, a styles.css file for the custom CSS styles, and a folder for the images used in the project.

To view the landing page, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The landing page is responsive and should display well on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project is a good starting point for those who are new to web development and want to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
